    <h2>One Vision, One Purpose</h2>

    <p> A slogan popularized by a fictional organization from one of the games
        that I played. This line defines a straight and clear goal towards one's
        life. If one is able to hold on to their vision and follow their purpose in life,
        they have better odds of success in their endeavors.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        [...] "One Vision, One Purpose" is about striving towards an ultimate goal.<br>
        [...] It implies single mindedness, that [they] will not be distracted by setbacks [...] and that
        [they are] willing to make a sacrifice for what they believe in.<br>

    </blockquote>
    <p> What about you? What about me? It is a personal question and no single person has the exact same answer,
        but a tiny percentage of it. We may help each other to find it, but eventually one must figure it out based
        on their own personal values.
